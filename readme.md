# About Martijn

I apply data science methods, image analyses and bio-informatic analyses to biological data.

I am currently member of the [biological Data Science Center](http://biodsc.nl) at the UvA biology department, embedded in the Goedhart/Gadella research group (http://www.molcyto.nl/), and part of the [Van Leeuwenhoek Centre for Advanced Microscopy (LCAM)](http://www.lcam-fnwi.nl/).

<!--Currently, I'm working in the Van Rooij lab at the Hubrecht. See https://github.com/vanrooij-lab/ for some of the repositories I recently worked on that are public. -->

## Previous positions
- Postdoctoral Researcher at Hubrecht Institute (Utrecht). Molecular Cardiology, Van Rooij group. Working mostly on RNA-Seq.
- PhD Student at AMOLF (Amsterdam). Biophysics, Tans group. Working on measuring and quantifying gene networks.
- Intern at AMOLF (Amsterdam). Biochemical Networks, Ten Wolde group. Simulating and understanding noise in gene neworks.
