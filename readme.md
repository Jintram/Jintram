# About Martijn
I apply data science methods, image analyses and bio-informatic analyses to biological data.

I'm currently member of the Data Science team at the UvA biology department, and I'm embedded in the Goedhart/Gadella research group (http://www.molcyto.nl/), where I perform (image) analysis of advanced microscopy.

<!--Currently, I'm working in the Van Rooij lab at the Hubrecht. See https://github.com/vanrooij-lab/ for some of the repositories I recently worked on that are public. -->

## Previous positions
Postdoctoral Researcher at Hubrecht Institute (Utrecht). Molecular Cardiology, Van Rooij group. Working mostly on RNA-Seq.

PhD Student at AMOLF (Amsterdam). Biophysics, Tans group. Working on measuring and quantifying gene networks.

MSc Student at AMOLF (Amsterdam). Biochemical Networks, Ten Wolde group. Simulating and understanding noise in gene neworks.
